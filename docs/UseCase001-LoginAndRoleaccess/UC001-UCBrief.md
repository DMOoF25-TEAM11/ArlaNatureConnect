# **Brief Use Case – UC01 Login & Role Access**

**Use Case ID:** UC01  
**Name:** Login & Role Access  
**Scope:** System prototype (Arla Nature Connect)  
**Level:** User goal  

**Primary Actors:**  
- Farmer  
- Consultant  
- Arla Employee  

**Description:**  
The user selects a role (Farmer, Consultant, or Arla Employee) on the front page to access the system.  
No password or email authentication is required, as this is a prototype.  
After selecting a role, the system grants access to the appropriate view — either directly to the dashboard (for Arla Employee) or via a user selection dropdown (for Farmer or Consultant).  
The role determines which functions and data are visible in the interface.

**Preconditions:**  
- The system is running and displays the start page.  

**Postconditions:**  
- The user is navigated to the correct dashboard with access permissions according to their role.  

**Backlog Relation:**  
A01–A10 (Identity & Access)
