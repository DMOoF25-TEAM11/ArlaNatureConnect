    title UC002B.1 – SSD: View Farms and Consultants for Assignment

    actor ArlaEmployee as Arla Employee
    participant System as System

    ArlaEmployee ->> System: Open "Nature Check Cases" module
    System -->> ArlaEmployee: Display list of farms with status (Tilføjet/Ikke tilføjet) and priority badges
    
    Note over System: System loads:<br/>- All farms<br/>- All active Nature Check Cases<br/>- All consultants<br/>- Aggregates data to show assignment status
```

**Notes:**
- The system displays farms with their assignment status ("Tilføjet" / "Ikke tilføjet") and priority badges.
- Farms with active cases show the assigned consultant's name and priority level.
- Consultants are displayed in a separate list, sorted alphabetically.
- This is a read-only operation - no data is modified.
