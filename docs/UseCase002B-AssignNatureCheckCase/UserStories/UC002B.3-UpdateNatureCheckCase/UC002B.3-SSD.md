    title UC002B.3 – SSD: Update Nature Check Case Assignment

    actor ArlaEmployee as Arla Employee
    participant System as System

    ArlaEmployee ->> System: getActiveCaseForFarm(farmId)
    System -->> ArlaEmployee: activeCase(caseId, consultantId, priority, notes)

    ArlaEmployee ->> System: updateCase(caseId, consultantId, priority, notes, rowVersion)
    alt Success
        System -->> ArlaEmployee: caseUpdated(caseId)
    else Error
        System -->> ArlaEmployee: error
    end
```

**Notes:**
- This SSD shows the high-level interaction for updating a Nature Check Case.
- All internal operations (validation, concurrency checks, etc.) are hidden within the system boundary.
