    title UC002B.4 – SSD: Create Farm (Inline)

    actor ArlaEmployee as Arla Employee
    participant System as System

    ArlaEmployee ->> System: createFarm(farmData)
    alt Success
        System -->> ArlaEmployee: farmCreated(farmId)
    else Error
        System -->> ArlaEmployee: error
    end
```

**Notes:**
- This SSD shows the high-level interaction for creating a farm.
- All internal operations (validation, owner reuse logic, etc.) are hidden within the system boundary.
