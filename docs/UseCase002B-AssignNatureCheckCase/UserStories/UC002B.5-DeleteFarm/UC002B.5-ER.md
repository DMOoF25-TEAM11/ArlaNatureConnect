# UC002B.5 – Entity Relationship Diagram

ER Diagram for Delete Farm. This builds upon UC002B.4.

**Note:** This diagram shows tables relevant to UC002B.5. Tables from UC001/UC002 (FARMS, PERSONS) are assumed to already exist.

```mermaid
erDiagram
    FARMS {
        uniqueidentifier Id PK
    }

    NATURE_CHECK_CASES {
        uniqueidentifier FarmId FK
        nvarchar Status
    }

    FARMS ||--o{ NATURE_CHECK_CASES : "has"
```

## Table Origins

| Table | Origin | Description |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| **FARMS** | UC002 | Farm information (assumed to exist from UC002) |
| **NATURE_CHECK_CASES** | UC002B | Nature Check Case assignments (from UC002B.1/UC002B.2) |

**Note:** UC002B.5 assumes that all tables from UC001, UC002, and previous UC002B user stories already exist.

## Deletion Constraints

- Farms with active cases (Status IN ('Assigned', 'InProgress')) cannot be deleted
- Foreign key constraints enforce referential integrity
