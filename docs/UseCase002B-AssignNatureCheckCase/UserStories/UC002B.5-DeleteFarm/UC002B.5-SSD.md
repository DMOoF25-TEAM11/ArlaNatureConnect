    title UC002B.5 – SSD: Delete Farm

    actor ArlaEmployee as Arla Employee
    participant System as System

    ArlaEmployee ->> System: deleteFarm(farmId)
    alt Success
        System -->> ArlaEmployee: farmDeleted(farmId)
    else Error
        System -->> ArlaEmployee: error
    end
```

**Notes:**
- This SSD shows the high-level interaction for deleting a farm.
- All internal operations (active case checks, cascade deletion, etc.) are hidden within the system boundary.
