# User Story – UC002B.5: Delete Farm

**As an** Arla employee,  
**I want** to delete a farm from the system,  
**so that** I can remove farms that are no longer relevant or were created by mistake.

---

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Given** I have selected a farm  
   **When** I click delete  
   **Then** the system checks if the farm has active Nature Check Cases

2. **Given** the farm has no active cases  
   **When** I confirm deletion  
   **Then** the farm is removed from the system

3. **Given** the farm has active cases  
   **When** I attempt to delete  
   **Then** the system shows an error: "Gården kan ikke slettes fordi den har aktive Natur Check opgaver."

---

## Notes

- Farms with active Nature Check Cases cannot be deleted
- Deletion is permanent and cascades to related data
- The system validates that no active cases exist before allowing deletion
