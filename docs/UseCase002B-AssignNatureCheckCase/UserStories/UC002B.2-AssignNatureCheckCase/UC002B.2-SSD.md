    title UC002B.2 – SSD: Assign Nature Check Case to Consultant

    actor ArlaEmployee as Arla Employee
    participant System as System

    ArlaEmployee ->> System: assignCase(farmId, consultantId, priority, notes)
    alt Success
        System -->> ArlaEmployee: caseAssigned(caseId)
    else Error
        System -->> ArlaEmployee: error
    end
```

**Notes:**
- This SSD shows the high-level interaction for assigning a Nature Check Case.
- All internal operations (validation, case creation, etc.) are hidden within the system boundary.
