# User Story – UC002B.2: Assign Nature Check Case to Consultant

**As an** Arla employee,  
**I want** to create a new Nature Check Case and assign it to a consultant,  
**so that** the consultant can begin working on the Nature Check for the selected farm.

---

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Given** I have selected a farm without an active case  
   **When** I select a consultant and click "Lav natur Check opgave"  
   **Then** a new Nature Check Case is created with status "Assigned"

2. **Given** I am assigning a case  
   **When** I select a priority level  
   **Then** the priority is stored in the database in English format ("Low", "Medium", "High", "Urgent")

3. **Given** I am assigning a case  
   **When** I enter optional notes  
   **Then** the notes are stored with the case

4. **Given** I have successfully assigned a case  
   **When** the case is created  
   **Then** a database notification is created for the consultant

5. **Given** I have successfully assigned a case  
   **When** the case is created  
   **Then** the farm's assignment status is updated to "Tilføjet"

6. **Given** I am assigning a case to a farm that already has an active case  
   **When** I attempt to create a new case  
   **Then** the system shows an error or allows me to update the existing case instead

- The case is automatically assigned to the selected consultant
- Priority is optional but stored in English format in the database
- The consultant receives a notification about the new assignment
- This enables the consultant to proceed with UC03 – Create Nature Check
